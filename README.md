## **Development**
Our analysis will accomplish the following:
- Use Pandas to clean and format our datasets
- Create a Jupyter Notebook describing our data exploration and cleanup process
- Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis
- Use Matplotlib to create 6-8 visualizations of our data (2 for each question we ask of our data)
- Output our visualizations as PNG images and in include them in our presentation
- We may use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to our primary research questions.
- Create a write-up summarizing our major findings
  - One heading for each primary research question with a short description of our findings with relevant plots
  
## **Presentation**
Our presentation will adhere to the following guidelines:
- Approximately 10 minutes in length
- Contain the source for the data used to answer our primary research questions
- Contain the data exploration and cleanup process (Jupyter Notebook)
- Contain the analysis process (Jupyter Notebook)
- Contain our conclusions, including a numerical summary and visualizations of that summary
- Contain the implication of our findings and what it means
