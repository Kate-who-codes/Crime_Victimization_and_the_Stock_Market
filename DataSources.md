**Disclaimer:** We will largely be using definitions as noted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics as to avoid straying from the intended interpretation of the dataset.
- What is this data?
  - Source
    -[Personal Victimization 1993-2019 Dataset](https://www.bjs.gov/developer/ncvs/index.cfm) from Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Crime Victimization Survey
  - Description
    - The survey provides data on violent and property victimization by select victim, household, and incident characteristics. The NCVS is the nation's(USA) primary source of information on criminal victimization. It is an annual data collection conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The NCVS collects information from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households on nonfatal crimes, reported and not reported to the police, against persons age 12 or older.
    - Definition: Personal Victimition
      - Personal victimization includes all violent victimization (rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, simple assault) and personal theft.
    - Notable [Variable Descriptions]:
      - **Weight** (weight) - The wieght used to calculate an estimate of victimizations. In a calculation of victimization rate, they are used to determine the numerator. This weight also accounts for high-frequency repeat victimizations, or series victimizations, which are six or more similar but separate victimizations that occur with such frequency that the victim is unable to recall each individual event or describe events in detail. BJS has decided to count series victimizations using the victim's estimate of the number of times the victimizations occurred during the prior 6 months, capping the number within each series at a maximum of 10 victimizations. Including series victimizations in national estimates can substantially increase the number and rate of violent victimization. However, trends in violence are generally similar regardless of whether series victimizations are included.
      - **Aggregate type of crime** (newcrime) - Personal victimization includes all violent victimization, rape, sexual assault, robbery, assault, and personal theft. This category includes both attempted and completed crimes. Violent victimization is defined as rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or simple assault. Murder is not measured by the NCVS because of an inability to question the victim. Personal theft/larceny includes purse-snatching or pocket-picking.
        - 1 = Violent victimization
        - 2 = Personal theft/larceny
      - **Region** (region) - The states have been divided into four groups or census regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West.
        - 1 = Northeast: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont
        - 2 = Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin
        - 3 = South: District of Columbia, Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia
        - 4 = West: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming
      - **Reporting to the police** (notify) - Specifies whether the crime was reported to police. To calculate the household victimization rate by reporting to the police, use the total household population as the denominator.
        - 1 = Yes, reported to the police
        - 2 = No, did not report to the police
        - 3 = Do not know
      - **Victim-offender relationship** (direl) - A classification of a crime victim's relationship to the offender for crimes involving direct contact between the two. For the analysis tool, this applies to crimes that involve contact between the victim and the offender (personal victimization). This distinction is not made for household victimization. To calculate the person victimization rate by victim-offender relationship, use the total person population as the denominator.
        - 1 = Intimates
        - 2 = Other relatives
        - 3 = well-known/casual acquaintances
        - 4 = Stranger
        - 5 = Do not know relationship
        - 6 = Do not know number of offenders
