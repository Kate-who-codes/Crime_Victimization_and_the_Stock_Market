## Abstract

## Hypothesis

## Body

### Data 
1)Bureau of Justice National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) API
2)Dow JOnes Industrial Average Data from Yahoo Finance
DJI Open, High, Low, Close and Volume data for each day since 1993
Chosen datasets are from well-established sources. Both govwrnment crime datat and stock results have been documented extensively throughout the years.
These data sources are reliable and easily obtainable

### Methodology
1)Importing Data
2)Data Exploration
3)Data Cleaning throughout the EDA process
4)Plotting was created using matplotlib notebook and matplotlib inline 
### Analysis
Research Questions include:
1)Does the performance of the stock market correlate with crime in the United States?
2)Are certain age groups more likely to be victims of certain crimes?
3)Have victimization rates changed over time?

### Results

## Conclusion

## **Development**
Our analysis will accomplish the following:
- Use Pandas to clean and format our datasets
- Create a Jupyter Notebook describing our data exploration and cleanup process
- Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis
- Use Matplotlib to create 6-8 visualizations of our data (2 for each question we ask of our data)
- Output our visualizations as PNG images and in include them in our presentation
- We may use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to our primary research questions.
- Create a write-up summarizing our major findings
  - One heading for each primary research question with a short description of our findings with relevant plots
  
## **Presentation**
Our presentation will adhere to the following guidelines:
- Approximately 10 minutes in length
- Contain the source for the data used to answer our primary research questions
- Contain the data exploration and cleanup process (Jupyter Notebook)
- Contain the analysis process (Jupyter Notebook)
- Contain our conclusions, including a numerical summary and visualizations of that summary
- Contain the implication of our findings and what it means
